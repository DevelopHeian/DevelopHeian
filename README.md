 <summary><h3>How I got Introduced to Software</h3></summary>
    In the summer of 2019, I made two new acquaintances. approximately towards the end of August. I met these guys in the gym, and we got things going. My first professional choice, completely unrelated to information technology, was dentistry. Two of my friends called me and arranged a meeting;n they talked about there own careers and what software is really all about. They introduced me in front-end programming and coding. I was suggested to build a website by one o the friends, but I had no idea how to accomplish it. However, I was really intrigued and interested in the idea of giving anything life. a vision, seeing it through, and showing it to the world. They offered me links, suggestions, and detailed directions on how to start a website, as well as links to other websites that would be useful. From there, I learned it on my own and fell in love with it. I'm currently putting my skills I've acquired over the years to the test as I work toward getting an entry-level job.
